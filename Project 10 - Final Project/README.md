#### Description:
The idea came to mind when i realized i had to put time into a project, as such might as well be a project that i would want to use daily. I had this free website for my company and i wanted to put some ideas to the test, in order to try to have more sales and more people coming to the landing page.
This webapp was made using Flask. I utilized CSS, HTML to build the main design of the web pages and flask to optimize the production of multiple pages. I have my website divided in sections, the root page a single page. the programs pages, different for each of the available programs. In the programs page I have utilized flask to create the multiple pages, utilizing a main layout as example. Then utilizing SQL i created a database that allowed Jinja to read and get the information that i needed in order to customize the page to the program the user wants to see. I have also utilized JavaScript in order to make some flashy moments, such as a navbar that disappears when the user scrolls down, allowing for a much better visual experience, or other functions such as reedirect to instagram pages, or even autoclick in a menu to show by default a certain option.
I intend to use this web app to sell my services as a personal trainer through a mobile app we have done. Also we have programed the web app having in mind mobile users, the most challenging part was actually understanding the different aspects and screen types. Other hard part was using javaScript, its a different language and actually posed some difficulty. However with some googling i was able to break through and understand a little bit more. HTML and CSS make more sense now aswell, since i used some free libraries to pick up icons and such, i had to understand how to manipulate images, text and such inside the phrases.
In the python file i didin't use a lot of routing options, just the main ones, but i made sure the SQL was imune to injections, via the use of the '?' placeholder.
In the CSS file i manipulated everything even if it was already used in a library, i wanted to make sure i costumized my app as i could in order to make a pretier HTML.
I tried to debug as much as i could, of course there are some errors here and there but anyway it should suffice for know, i'll keep making it better over time.
Also, i hosted the site in a live website called pythonanywhere so its up 24/7.

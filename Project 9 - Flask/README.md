If you’re not quite sure what it means to buy and sell stocks (i.e., shares of a company), head here for a tutorial.



You’re about to implement C$50 Finance, a web app via which you can manage portfolios of stocks. Not only will this tool allow you to check real stocks’ actual prices and portfolios’ values, it will also let you buy (okay, “buy”) and sell (okay, “sell”) stocks by querying for stocks’ prices.



Indeed, there are tools (one is known as IEX) that let you download stock quotes via their API (application programming interface) using URLs like https://api.iex.cloud/v1/data/core/quote/nflx?token=API\_KEY. Notice how Netflix’s symbol (NFLX) is embedded in this URL; that’s how IEX knows whose data to return.
